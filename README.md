# The jQuery Archive

An archive of jQuery versions **before Oct 27 2006** when it was released under the MIT License.

It's easy to find [every version of jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/) starting from Oct 27 2006. But that's not the case with older versions of jQuery. According to the [official history](https://jquery.org/history/), John Resig started working on jQuery in late 2005.

The earliest version of jQuery I have found so far is from Sat, 01 Jul 2006. Treasure hunt time, *I challenge you to find an older version!*
