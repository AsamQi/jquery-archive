# The jQuery Archive

An archive of old-school jQuery alpha versions from before version 1.0 was release on Oct 27 2006.

It's easy to find [every the version of jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/) starting with 1.0. But that's not the case of the alpha versions of jQuery. According to the [official history](https://jquery.org/history/), John Resig started working on jQuery in late 2005. The earliest version of jQuery I have found so far is revision 110 from Sat, 01 Jul 2006. Teasure hunt time, *I challenge you to find an older version!*
