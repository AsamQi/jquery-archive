# The jQuery Archive

An archive of old-school jQuery alpha versions (before revision #509 was released under the MIT License on Oct 27 2006).

It's easy to find [every version of jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/) starting with revision #509. But that's not the case with older versions of jQuery. According to the [official history](https://jquery.org/history/), John Resig started working on jQuery in late 2005.

The earliest version of jQuery I have found so far is revision #110 from Sat, 01 Jul 2006. Treasure hunt time, *I challenge you to find an older version!*
