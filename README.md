# The jQuery Archive

The goal of this archive is to find and preserve the alpha versions jQuery **before October 27th 2006**.

It's simple to find [every version of jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/) starting from October 27th 2006. But that's not the case with older versions of jQuery. Thanks to John and we have the original project he started with he called jselect.
