# The jQuery Archive

The goal of this archive is to find and preserve the older versions jQuery **before October 27th 2006**.

It's simple to find [every version of jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/) starting from October 27th 2006. But that's not the case with older versions of jQuery. According to the [official history](https://jquery.org/history/), John Resig started working on jQuery in late 2005.

The earliest version of jQuery I have found so far is from July 1st 2006. Treasure hunt time, *I challenge you to find an older version!*

This seach query will help you get started: https://searchcode.com/?q=2006+John+Resig&lan=22
